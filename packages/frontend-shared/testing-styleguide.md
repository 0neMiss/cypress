# DRAFT - CYPRESS TESTING STYLE GUIDE

## Status of this document

This draft is a starting point. A tool to help us converge on some common practices in terms of how we write tests, and a reference point for how we can review test PRs with each other. Especially it should be a place where we document expectations around coding style in tests.

I'm starting by documenting the practices that I see us currently doing in the new parts of the codebase, or things we seem to have agreed we'd like to do. Not exhaustive, and not prescriptive.
